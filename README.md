<h1>Using R to measure species variation with Principal Component Analyses</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of using data from different measurements of the skull from different species of animal to measure variation across species. The script creates a screeplot that plots the principal components in order allowing them to be viewed for variance. This screeplot directly correlates with a selection menu that allows the user to pick principle components as an x and y axis for a coordinate system. After that the principal component analysis is complete.
